=== Mission Statement ===
The website is intended to display content for a (fictional) group of film critics. The primary content is film reviews.

With the subject matter, I have attempted to go for a very cinematic look, with a dark background and heavy emphasis on images just like in a cinema.

=== Index ===
The main page is intended to showcase the featured review as well as the latest reviews.
