<center><h1>Film Junkie.com</h1>
<h3>vz19513 - Solo Project</h3></center>


<h2>1. Running & Access</h2>
<p>Run (with debug) using command:  DEBUG=website:* npm start </p>
<p>Access via: https://localhost:3000/</p>
<p>It will flag as unsafe due to the self-signed security certificate - allow insecure content to access.</p>

<h2>2. Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The website is intended to display content for a (fictional) group of film critics. The primary content is film reviews.</p>
<p>With the subject matter, I have attempted to go for a very cinematic look, with a dark background and heavy emphasis on images just like in a cinema.</p>

<h2>3. Sections</h2>
<h3>Index (Homepage)</h3>
<p>The main page is intended to showcase the featured review as well as the latest reviews.</p>

<h3>About</h3>
<p>A page to explain to the user about who the team are and what their background is. Tabulated container with photos of the team and details of each reviewer.</p>
<p>The images are not my own have been sourced from the following links:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-wearing-black-zip-up-jacket-near-beach-smiling-at-the-photo-736716/">Male #1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/man-standing-on-street-839011/">Male #2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/closeup-photo-of-woman-with-brown-coat-and-gray-top-733872/">Female #1</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Contact</h3>
<p>The Contact page is comprised essentially of two elements. A google map widget that shows the location of their office (simply set to UoB at the moment) and a contact form whereby
the user can send a message to the reviewers.</p>

<p>When the form is actioned, the data is checked and if it is valid then an INSERT query is actioned and the data is entered into the database.</p>

<h3>All Films</h3>
<p>This is a page contains a list of films that the group has reviewed along with some key details. This content is pulled from a database containing details of each reviewed film, accessed using SQLite3 and Ajax.</p>

<h3>Review Pages</h3>
There are web pages for each film review. Each review page will contain a short slideshow including images from the film, rating, reviewer and the written review.

<h2>4. Estimated Grades</h3>

Self-marking and justification:
<ul>
<li><b>A for HTML</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Significant use of HTML in a variety of forms throughout and regular use of W3 validator.</li>
<li>Many of the main pages ('About', 'Contact', 'Home'...) have been created using Jade templates to produce HTML.</li>
<li>Text manipulation: use of bold, headers, centering, aligning, bulletpoints etc.</li>
<li>Creation of containers such as forms or sidebars which are then manipulated by CSS.</li>
</ul>
	
<li><b>A for CSS</b></li>
I have utilised CSS throughout my website. As recommended in the guidance, these are contained within stylesheets that 
are them linked to from within the HTML document.
<ul>
<li>Use of fade in & fade out (on hover) effects for links on the main page.</li>
<li>Use of opacity effects (on hover) for images on the main page.</li>
<li>Customising text layouts. For example, creation of a two column newspaper-style text layout for the review pages.</li>
<li>Use of CSS to set style and positioning of 'Next' & 'Previous' page buttons.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>B for JS</b></li>
There is a substantial amount of client-side Javascript throughout my website.
<ul>
<li>A tabbed window using a combination of Javascript and CSS on the 'About' page. This was created by adapting an existing template.</li>
<li>Created a picture slideshow using Javascript on the film review pages. This was also adapted from an existing template.</li>
<center><img src="/images/4-star-rating.png" alt="rating"></center>
<li>I wrote a Javascript function ('setRating') which manipulates the HTML classes to display a star rating based on input. i.e.
Entering 4 into the function displays a four star rating as above.</li>
<li>I also wrote a very simple 'Like' button. This produces a message which is kept in local storage and is therefore reproduced everytime
the user visits that particular page.</li>
</ul>


<li><b>B for PNG</b></li>

The following are were all acheived using the GIMP image manipulation program:
<ul>
<li>Exporting downloaded image files as .PNG</li>
<li>On the 'About' page, the main image ('The Team') is a collage of three images created using layering, cropping and using paths to select diagonal areas that were filled
to create dividers between the images.</li>
<li>The next images on this page (John/James/Sarah) were cropped so that every one was the same size and then the colours modified to grayscale.</li>
<li>Similarly, I built the image on the 'Work In Progress' <a href="https://localhost:3000/wip.html">page</a> initially using layering and the transform tools.
  I then used the drop shadow filter and the glow filter to improve the overrall look of the image.</li>
<li>On the Home page, images were cropped and exported to fit their respective boxes. In some cases, I used the Levels tool in GIMP to amend the brightness & contrast of the images.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>B for SVG</b></li>
<ul>
<li>Use of Inkscape to create the SVG banner header.</li>
<li>This is a simple SVG file including text and an altered image. The image was found online, the colour was changed, rotated and then joined with the text.</li>
<li>On the Contact page, I created two 'wings' using the shapes tool in Inkscape and manipulating the nodes in the path editor.</li>
<li>The favicon was created using an online custom icon creator.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>B for Server</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Set up a server and a router using an express tutorial.</li>
<li>Port numbers are defined and the server is able to produce 404 errors for unknown links.</li>
<center><img src="/images/certificate-image.png" alt="certificate" width="500" height="600"></center>
<li>Added a self-signed security certificate (requires allowing insecure content). I am aware this would be insufficient for a live website which
would require certification from an authority but this demonstrates an understanding of how this would be implemented.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>B for Database</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Manually created a SQL databasee: this database contains a table for film details and a table for messages sent via the contact form.</li>
<li>SELECT query is utilised to display the film data (on the 'All Films' page.</li>
<li>INSERT query is utilised to insert the form data on the contact page into the database.</li>
<li>Error messages are produced if fields do not contain data or a success message is produced if input is accepted.</li>
<li>Currently, the responses are only in the form of JSON strings - I have not yet found a way to encorporate these into a more user friendly manner as yet.</li>
</ul>

<li><b>B for Dynamic pages</b></li>

<ul>
<li>Use of Javascript routes to switch between views.</li>
<li>Use of Jade templates to create these views. Each of the views from the index inherits it's main characteristics from the 'Layout' template. This makes the website easier to maintain. For example, if the
administrator wants to amend a link in the sidebar, they only need to amend the 'Layout' template rather than manually edit every page.</li>
<li>Some key elements of the review pages are dynamic. For example, the user needs only set the film title and the relevant images are found and displayed in the slideshow.</li>
</ul>
